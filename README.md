# AgroDetect

A deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify potato plant leaves into healthy, late blight, and early blight categories. The project includes a FastAPI server for inference and a frontend app for easy interaction.

Key Features:
- Trained CNN model for potato leaf disease classification
- FastAPI server for making predictions via API calls
- Frontend app for user-friendly interface
- Supports classification into three categories: healthy, late blight, early blight
